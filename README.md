# Motivation 

To allow NUS Students/Staff enjoy the exclusive benefits of a loyalty programme app specifically tailored for NUS Students/Staff when they patronize retail shops/dining places within the NUS Premises. 

Currently, there is no unified loyalty programme present on campus and payments mainly are through bank apps with no added benefits/returns. 
In light of the present economic outlook where many people value rewards programmes, we hope to provide a special, unified platform on campus to reward users for their spending our campus, where they spend a large portion of time everyday.


**Aim**

We want to create a seamless app with an intuitive user-interface for loyalty programme within NUS premises to benefit both NUS student and staff as well as retail shops/dining outlets on campus.

From the consumers’ perspective, they could use the app to earn points to exchange for rewards from participating brands located within NUS premises. This rewards them for their everyday spending on campus, besides merely paying the merchants. This app lets them view their spending habits too.

From the retailers’ perspective, they could use the opportunity of this loyalty scheme to promote their business, through the provision of cashback vouchers, as well as hosting seasonal “upsized points” promotions to boost sales (Increased rate of point accumulation). 


# User Stories

[Please describe what the users would be able to do with your system.]

1. As a NUS student/staff, I would be able to gain points with every dollar that I spend at all retails within NUS premises and exchange for vouchers / rewards. These vouchers / rewards would save me some money in the long-run.

2. As a NUS Student/Staff, I would want track my expenditure and spending habits in NUS. (This is especially the case for those with tight financial budgets such as Exchange Students)

3. As a retailer of NUS, I can expect more students/staff to patronize my store as I offer vouchers in the loyalty app as well as introduce seasonal promotions in terms of “upsized points”. (Retailers may also include merchandise shops set up buy NUS clubs/societies)
